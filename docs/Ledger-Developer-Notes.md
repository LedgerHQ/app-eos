## Notes

Highly recomended to setup the Speculos emulator. Installing Ledger Blue is optional, and recomend holding off on the Ledger Blue tools untill you need them. 

### Setup
   - Follow instructions in [README](../README.md) to build & compile 
   - Setup the [Speculor Emulator](./speculos-emulator-setup.md)
   - Optionally setup [Ledger Blue](./ledger-blue-setup.md) command line tools 
   
## Testing
   - Instructions on [Running Tests](./running-test.md)
   - LedgerHQ notes on [Testing with Ragger](../tests/functional/usage.md)
