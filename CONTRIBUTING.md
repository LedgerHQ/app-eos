# Welcome

We are glad you are here to help. This document goes over the process of submitting changes and making improvements.

## Steps

1. Open an Issue
2. Create a Branch for your work with issue number at the end
3. Make your changes
4. Check your changes by running [`make scan-build`](./README.md#clang-analyzer)
5. Push your changed to `develop` branch to test. Note this runs git actions to verify build
6. Create a PR to merge the changes from your Branch `#2` into `main`
7. Merge into github `LedgerHQ/app-eos` on `master` branch
8. Fill out [LedgerHQ Form](https://ledger.typeform.com/Nano-App?typeform-source=developers.ledger.com) to start review process
   - we are public release
